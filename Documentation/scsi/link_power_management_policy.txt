This parameter allows the user to set the link (interface) power management.
There are 4 possible options:

Value			Effect
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
firmware		Inherit configuration from the state programmed by
			the firmware during system init.

min_power		Tell the controller to try to make the link use the
			least possible power when possible.  This may
			sacrifice some performance due to increased latency
			when coming out of lower power states.

max_performance		Generally, this means no power management.  Tell
			the controller to have performance be a priority
			over power management.

medium_power		Tell the controller to enter a lower power state
			when possible, but do not enter the lowest power
			state, thus improving latency over min_power setting.
